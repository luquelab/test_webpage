| [**Small viruses reveal bidirectional evolution between HK97-fold viruses and encapsulins via procapsids**](#small-viruses-reveal-bidirectional-evolution-between-hk97-fold-viruses-and-encapsulins-via-procapsids-2025-08-29) | August 29, 2025 |
| First author **Abelardo Aguilar**, with **Antoni Luque** (PI) and **Omer Nadel**, shared on bioRxiv a manuscript that describes how small uncultured HK97-fold viruses bridge viruses and prokaryotic proteins, supporting bidirectional evolutionary transitions via procapsids. Their findings suggest that capsids in nature might have overlooked biochemical roles. Manuscript under **peer review at Nature Communications**. [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.18.659913v3) | <img src="{{ '/assets/images/news/Small_viruses_reveal_bidir_evo_via_procapsids_QRCODE_Biorxiv.png' | relative_url }}" width="180"> |
