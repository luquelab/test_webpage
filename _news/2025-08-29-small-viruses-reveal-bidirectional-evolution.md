summary: >
  First author **Abelardo Aguilar**, with **Antoni Luque** (PI) and **Omer Nadel**, report small uncultured
  HK97-fold viruses lacking portal/tail genes that resemble encapsulins and procapsids. Structural phylogenetics
  supports bidirectional evolution via lysogeny-enabled transitions. We propose procapsids as the ancestral HK97 shell
  and a bridge between modern viruses and encapsulins. Manuscript under **peer review at Nature Communications**.
