# Luque Lab

![home_page]({{ '/assets/images/shared/hpv_small_polygon_mix_Thomas_Splettstoesser_cropped.jpg' | relative_url }})

Our lab investigates the physical structure, ecology, and evolution of viruses, combining theoretical biophysics, bioinformatics, and predictive modeling in close collaboration with experimentalists. The lab moved to the [Department of Biology at the University of Miami](https://biology.as.miami.edu/) in Fall 2023 after nearly eight years forming part of the [Viral Information Institute (VII)](https://viralization.org/), the Computational Science Research Center, and the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at San Diego State University.
